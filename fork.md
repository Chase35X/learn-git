# Creating a fork

Your goal is to create and sync a fork of the `git-learn` repository.

## Forking learn-git

First, go to [the main page](https://github.com/bualpha/learn-git)
for the learn-git repository. Click on the `Fork` button at the top of the page.

When we "fork" a repository, what we are doing is creating a copy of the
owner's repository that we own. GitHub copies all of the contents of the
repository, creating a new repository under our username. You can think of this
roughly as going `Ctrl-C` `Ctrl-V` to someone else's work, sticking your name
on it, and starting to make your own edits to it.

Once you've created your own fork, you'll come to a page that gives you several
settings. The only one you should change right now is the "Description"
section. You can add whatever short description of your new repository you'd
like to. Think of this as tweet-sized; try to keep it to less than 140
characters.

## Next step

Next, go to to `name.md` to clone your fork, edit your name, and commit your
change.
