# Learning Git

This project is intended to get you up to speed with the software tools Git
and GitHub, which you will be using both during Quant and in your classes,
projects, and careers afterwards. This is not meant to be comprehensive but
instead give you a place to get started. After finishing the assignment, you'll
be able to use the Git commands clone, pull, add, commit, and push, as well
as how to fork a repository.

Your assignment is to create a fork of this repository, add your name to the
names.txt file, and submit a pull request.

## Differences between git and GitHub
In this club, we will be using git and GitHub. Here are some of the differences
between the two tools:
* Git is the software we use to manage our projects. GitHub is a platform
that hosts our projects and allows us to use Git better.
* Git is an open-source project. GitHub is a company.
* Git operates on the command line (your terminal), while you use GitHub on
the Internet.
* Git is a local program downloaded onto your computer that stores
repositories and code on your device. GitHub hosts repositories on its servers
("in the cloud").

If you want to learn more about the two, you can visit their home pages and
read the documentation featured there.

## Steps to complete

1. Download a git software package and create a GitHub account. See
`account.md` to figure out how to do this. (skip this part if you already have
git and a GitHub account)
2. Fork this repository (see `fork.md`).
3. Add your name to names.txt (see `name.md`).
4. Submit a pull request with your change (see `pr.md`).
