# Setting up Git

This page will help you download the git software package and create a GitHub
account. If you already have these things, please skip this part.

## Creating a GitHub account

To create a GitHub account, go to [their website](https://github.com/) and
follow the steps to sign up.  We recommend using a personal email to set up
your account rather than your school one, but you can change that field after
you create your account.

For a step-by-step guide, [follow the steps
here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).

## Downloading Git

This will depend on the type of operating system you have.

**Apple:** If you are using MacOS, see 
[GitHub](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) on how to download git. If
you are not familiar with your command line, try using the installer first
before moving to the command line to link your GitHub account.

**Windows:** Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) and
follow the instructions for downloading Git (or Git Bash) onto your computer.
If you get lost, use Stack Overflow, AI tools, the Internet etc. to help you
out.

## Configuring Git and GitHub

Now that you have downloaded Git and GitHub, it's time to configure the two.
The goal here is to link your GitHub account to the Git software that you just
downloaded onto your computer. Once you do this, your commits, repositories,
and other things you do on your computer will appear when you go online and
look at your GitHub account.

There are two parts to this step: setting your Git username and email, and
authenticating yourself.

### Setting username and email

To set your username and email, follow the instructions for steps 2 and 3
on [this webpage](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).
For your username, follow the instructions for setting your Git username for
every repository on your computer (unless you have a reason not to). For
your email, associate the email address you signed up with (your school or
personal email) with your Git, and set this for every repository again.

**NOTE:** If you are an Apple user, you should be executing these command-line
commands on your normal terminal. If you are a Windows user, you should be
executing these commands in your Git or Bash terminal that you downloaded
earlier, NOT your Windows command line.

### Authenticating yourself

For this part, I recommend [adding an SSH 
key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
Personally, I've found this easier to set up and deal with.

## Next steps
