For this task, the goal is to learn the following commands and things:
- how to fork a repository from GitHub  
- cloning a fork
- git remote add upstream
- why fork repos in the first place?

For this task, we will be forking learn-git, cloning the fork, describing
the differences between this and the bualpha/learn-git, and syncing a fork
(git remote add upstream). We'll then go into why you'd want to fork a
repository in the first place, how that is useful in general, for open source,
and for our club.
