For this task, the goal is to learn the following commands:
- git branch
- git checkout
- git switch
- git merge
- git rebase
- git log

checkout - like checking a book out from the library
creating a branch
renaming a branch
switching branches
push branch to remote repository
merging
rebasing
delete a branch after merging

For this activity, the task is to create three different branches with three
versions of one python file. We will have a separate example from what they
will be working on. Ours will be a script to print prime numbers. Theirs will
be a script for fizzbuzz.

// Note: this should come after forking, that way they can have a fork of
the repository on their local machine by this point that won't mess up
the main repository
