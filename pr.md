# Submit a pull request

To submit a pull request, go to your fork's repository on GitHub. Go to the
`Pull Request` tab at the top of the page, and click `New pull request`. Click
`Create pull request`, and add a descriptive title and message for why you
are making your pull request. Finally, click `Create pull request`.

Once this is done, we (the owner) will review your PR and approve it if
it matches with the repository.

Now, you have finished your assignment. Set up your project repositories
using the commands you've learned here.
